# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The ImpactHub AI platform currently has a large JavaScript bundle (583KB minified) that impacts loading performance, especially for users in marginalized communities with slower internet connections. This feature will implement code splitting, dynamic imports, and bundle optimization to improve initial load times and overall user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user with a slow internet connection, I want the application to load quickly with minimal initial bundle size, so that I can access the platform even with limited bandwidth.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the initial bundle SHALL be less than 250KB minified
2. WHEN a user navigates to a specific feature THEN only the required code for that feature SHALL be loaded
3. WHEN the application starts THEN critical path components SHALL load first before non-essential features
4. WHEN a user accesses the ImpactLearn interface THEN it SHALL load independently from the main AI dashboard code

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the build system to automatically split code into logical chunks, so that the application maintains optimal performance as new features are added.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the build process runs THEN vendor libraries SHALL be separated into their own chunks
2. WHEN route-based components are built THEN each major route SHALL have its own chunk
3. WHEN AI components are built THEN they SHALL be grouped into feature-specific chunks
4. WHEN the build completes THEN no single chunk SHALL exceed 300KB minified

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user accessing different parts of the platform, I want smooth navigation between sections without unnecessary loading delays, so that my workflow is not interrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates between routes THEN the transition SHALL be smooth with loading indicators
2. WHEN a chunk is loading THEN a appropriate loading state SHALL be displayed
3. WHEN a chunk fails to load THEN a retry mechanism SHALL be available
4. WHEN chunks are cached THEN subsequent visits SHALL load instantly from cache

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want visibility into bundle sizes and loading performance, so that I can monitor and maintain optimal performance over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the build process completes THEN a bundle analysis report SHALL be generated
2. WHEN chunks exceed size thresholds THEN warnings SHALL be displayed during build
3. WHEN the application loads THEN performance metrics SHALL be trackable
4. WHEN new features are added THEN their impact on bundle size SHALL be measurable
