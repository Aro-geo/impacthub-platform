# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Configure Vite build optimization and manual chunks



  - Update vite.config.ts with rollupOptions and manual chunk configuration
  - Set up vendor chunks for React, React Router, TanStack Query, Radix UI, and Supabase
  - Configure chunk size warning limits and build optimization settings
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.4_

- [x] 2. Implement route-based code splitting with lazy loading



  - Convert static imports to dynamic imports using React.lazy for all page components
  - Wrap lazy-loaded routes with Suspense boundaries and loading states
  - Create reusable LoadingSpinner component for route transitions
  - Update App.tsx routing configuration to use lazy-loaded components
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 3.1, 3.2_

- [ ] 3. Create error boundaries and retry mechanisms for chunk loading
  - Implement ChunkErrorBoundary component with retry functionality
  - Add network-aware loading strategies for different connection types
  - Create fallback components for critical chunk loading failures
  - Implement exponential backoff retry logic for failed chunk loads
  - _Requirements: 3.3, 3.4_

- [ ] 4. Split AI components into feature-specific chunks
  - Group AI components (LearningPathGenerator, QuizCreator, HomeworkHelper, etc.) into logical chunks
  - Implement dynamic loading for AI tools in AIDashboard component
  - Create AIComponentRegistry for on-demand AI tool loading
  - Add loading states specific to AI tool initialization
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 2.3_

- [ ] 5. Optimize ImpactLearn components for independent loading
  - Separate ImpactLearn pages and components into dedicated chunks
  - Implement lazy loading for ImpactLearn-specific routes and components
  - Optimize ImpactLearn bundle for low-bandwidth scenarios
  - Add ImpactLearn-specific loading states and error handling
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 3.1_

- [ ] 6. Add bundle analysis and monitoring tools
  - Install and configure webpack-bundle-analyzer for build analysis
  - Create bundle size reporting script for CI/CD integration
  - Implement runtime performance metrics collection for chunk loading
  - Add bundle size tests to prevent regression
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_

- [ ] 7. Implement preloading strategies for improved UX
  - Add intelligent preloading for likely-to-be-visited routes
  - Implement hover-based preloading for navigation links
  - Create connection-aware preloading that adapts to network conditions
  - Add cache warming strategies for frequently used chunks
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.4_

- [ ] 8. Create comprehensive loading states and UX improvements
  - Design and implement consistent loading UI components across the application
  - Add progress indicators for chunk loading operations
  - Create skeleton screens for major page transitions
  - Implement smooth transitions between loading states and loaded content
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2_

- [ ] 9. Add performance monitoring and analytics
  - Implement chunk load time tracking and reporting
  - Create performance dashboard for monitoring bundle optimization effectiveness
  - Add automated alerts for bundle size threshold violations
  - Set up performance regression detection in CI/CD pipeline
  - _Requirements: 4.3, 4.4_

- [ ] 10. Write comprehensive tests for bundle optimization features
  - Create unit tests for chunk loading utilities and error boundaries
  - Write integration tests for lazy loading and route transitions
  - Add performance tests to verify bundle size targets are met
  - Create end-to-end tests for error recovery and retry mechanisms
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.4, 3.3_
