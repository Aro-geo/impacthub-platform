# Grade-Based Content Filtering Implementation

## Problem
Grade 12 users were seeing quizzes and lessons from all grades (including Grade 5 content), instead of only seeing content appropriate for their grade level.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Lessons Filtering (Already Working)
- **File**: `src/components/simple-lessons/LessonsSection.tsx`
- **Implementation**: Grade filtering was already correctly implemented
- **Logic**: Non-admin users only see lessons where `simple_lessons.grade = userProfile.grade`

### 2. Quiz Interface Filtering (Fixed)
- **File**: `src/components/simple-lessons/QuizInterface.tsx`
- **Changes Made**:
  - First fetch grade-appropriate lesson IDs from `simple_lessons` table
  - Then fetch quizzes using `lesson_quizzes.lesson_id IN (grade_appropriate_lesson_ids)`
  - This ensures quizzes are filtered by the lessons that belong to the user's grade

### 3. Practice Section Filtering (Enhanced)
- **File**: `src/components/simple-lessons/PracticeSection.tsx`
- **Changes Made**:
  - Updated `fetchQuizStats()` to filter quiz attempts by grade-appropriate lessons
  - Updated `fetchRecentAttempts()` to filter recent attempts by grade-appropriate lessons
  - Maintained existing lesson filtering logic

### 4. Lesson Progress Service (Enhanced)
- **File**: `src/services/lessonProgressService.ts`
- **Changes Made**:
  - Updated `getUserStats()` method to count only grade-appropriate lessons in statistics
  - Non-admin users' progress percentages now calculated based on their grade's lessons only

### 5. Overview Section (Already Working)
- **File**: `src/components/simple-lessons/OverviewSection.tsx`
- **Implementation**: Grade filtering was already correctly implemented

## Database Structure Used

### simple_lessons table
```sql
- id (UUID)
- title (VARCHAR)
- grade (INTEGER) -- Key field for filtering (1-12)
- subject_id (UUID)
- is_published (BOOLEAN)
```

### lesson_quizzes table
```sql
- id (UUID)
- lesson_id (UUID) -- Foreign key to simple_lessons
- question (TEXT)
- options (JSONB)
- correct_answer (INTEGER)
```

### profiles table
```sql
- id (UUID)
- grade (INTEGER) -- User's grade level (1-12)
- role (VARCHAR) -- 'admin' users see all content
```

## Filtering Logic

### For Regular Users (Non-Admin)
1. Check user's grade from `profiles.grade`
2. Filter lessons: `WHERE grade = user_grade`
3. Filter quizzes: `WHERE lesson_id IN (grade_appropriate_lesson_ids)`
4. Filter progress: Only count grade-appropriate lessons in statistics

### For Admin Users
- See all content regardless of grade
- Admin detection: `profile.role = 'admin'` OR `email = 'geokullo@gmail.com'`

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### Grade 12 User Should See:
- Only Grade 12 lessons in lessons section
- Only quizzes from Grade 12 lessons in practice section
- Progress statistics based only on Grade 12 lessons
- Recent quiz attempts only from Grade 12 lessons

### Grade 5 User Should See:
- Only Grade 5 lessons in lessons section
- Only quizzes from Grade 5 lessons in practice section
- Progress statistics based only on Grade 5 lessons
- Recent quiz attempts only from Grade 5 lessons

### Admin Users Should See:
- All lessons from all grades
- All quizzes from all lessons
- Progress statistics for all lessons
- All quiz attempts

## Files Modified
1. `src/components/simple-lessons/QuizInterface.tsx` - Enhanced quiz filtering
2. `src/components/simple-lessons/PracticeSection.tsx` - Enhanced practice filtering
3. `src/services/lessonProgressService.ts` - Enhanced progress statistics

## Testing Recommendations
1. Login as Grade 12 user - verify only Grade 12 content appears
2. Login as Grade 5 user - verify only Grade 5 content appears  
3. Login as admin - verify all content appears
4. Check lesson counts in progress statistics match grade-specific totals
5. Verify quiz practice only shows grade-appropriate questions
