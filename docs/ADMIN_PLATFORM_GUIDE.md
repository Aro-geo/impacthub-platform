profiles (id, name, email, role, created_at, location, impact_points, badges)

-- Community content
community_posts (id, title, content, user_id, upvotes, is_featured, created_at)
post_comments (id, content, post_id, user_id, created_at)

-- Learning activities
learning_activities (id, user_id, activity_type, subject, score, created_at)
lesson_progress (id, user_id, lesson_id, progress_percentage, completed_at)

-- AI interactions
ai_interactions (id, user_id, interaction_type, status, created_at)

-- System monitoring
incident_logs (id, level, message, component, timestamp, metadata)
performance_metrics (id, metric, value, timestamp, metadata)
```
