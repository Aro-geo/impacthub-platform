# Database and App Loading Optimization Guide

This guide summarizes the optimization work done to improve database performance and reduce application loading times.

## Implemented Optimizations

### 1. Database Query Optimization

- **Query Caching System**: Implemented a time-based caching system that stores query results in memory with configurable TTL (Time To Live)
- **Minimal Selects**: Created utility functions to select only the columns needed instead of full table data
- **Batch Processing**: Implemented batch operations for database writes to reduce the number of API calls
- **Prefetching**: Added prefetching for commonly accessed data during idle times

### 2. Database Structure Optimization

- **Indexes**: Added indexes to frequently queried columns:
  - `lesson_progress.user_id`
  - `lesson_progress.lesson_id`
  - `lesson_progress.status`
  - `posts.created_at`
  - `posts.user_id`
  - `posts.subject_id`
  - `comments.post_id`
  - `comments.user_id`

- **Full-Text Search**: Implemented efficient text search for posts
  - Added `tsvector` column and GIN index
  - Created triggers to maintain search vectors automatically

- **Optimized Functions**: Added database functions for common operations
  - `increment_post_upvotes` and `decrement_post_upvotes`
  - `get_trending_posts` for efficient trend calculation
  - `get_lessons_with_subjects` for optimized joins

### 3. Application Loading Optimization

- **Progressive Loading**: Implemented priority-based loading where critical resources load first
- **Non-blocking Operations**: Used `requestIdleCallback` and `setTimeout` for background tasks
- **Lazy Components**: Continued using React.lazy for code splitting
- **Resource Prioritization**: Categorized resources as critical vs. non-critical

## Files Created/Modified

1. **New Utilities**:
   - `src/utils/dbOptimization.ts` - Core database optimization utilities
   - `src/services/communityService.ts` - Optimized community operations

2. **Enhanced Components**:
   - `src/components/shared/DatabaseOptimizer.tsx` - Simple data prefetching
   - `src/components/shared/AppOptimizer.tsx` - Comprehensive app optimization

3. **Database Migrations**:
   - `supabase/migrations/20240301_optimize_queries.sql` - Index creation and function definitions

4. **Core Application**:
   - `src/App.tsx` - Added optimizers to the main application flow

## Performance Monitoring

The optimizations include instrumentation to measure and track key performance metrics:

- **Time to Interactive**: Measured from app start to when critical resources are loaded
- **Resource Load Progress**: Tracking how many resources have been loaded
- **Performance Reporting**: Metrics are sent to the incident analysis service

## Next Steps

1. **Service Optimization**: Apply similar optimization patterns to:
   - File storage services
   - User notification services
   - Analytics tracking services

2. **Further Database Optimization**:
   - Implement connection pooling
   - Add query plan analysis for complex queries
   - Consider materialized views for complex aggregations

3. **Progressive Enhancement**:
   - Implement skeleton screens for faster perceived loading
   - Add priority-based image loading
   - Consider web workers for CPU-intensive operations
