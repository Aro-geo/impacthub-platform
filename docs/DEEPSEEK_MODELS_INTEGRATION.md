## Technical Implementation

### Configuration (`src/config/aiConfig.ts`)
```typescript
export const AI_CONFIG = {
  MODELS: {
    CHAT: 'deepseek-chat',
    REASONER: 'deepseek-reasoner'
  },
  MODEL_SELECTION: {
    REASONING_TASKS: [...],
    CONVERSATIONAL_TASKS: [...]
  }
}
```

### Automatic Model Selection
```typescript
export function getOptimalModel(taskType: string): string {
  if (REASONING_TASKS.includes(taskType)) {
    return AI_CONFIG.MODELS.REASONER;
  }
  if (CONVERSATIONAL_TASKS.includes(taskType)) {
    return AI_CONFIG.MODELS.CHAT;
  }
  return AI_CONFIG.MODELS.CHAT; // Default fallback
}
```

### Enhanced AI Service
The `aiService.ts` now includes:
- Intelligent model selection based on task type
- Optimized parameters for each model
- Specialized prompts for different capabilities
- Performance monitoring and logging

## New AI Methods

### Advanced Reasoning Methods (using deepseek-reasoner)

#### 1. Complex Problem Solving
```typescript
const solution = await solveComplexProblem(
  "How can a small city reduce carbon footprint by 30% in 5 years?",
  "environmental"
);
```

#### 2. Mathematical Reasoning
```typescript
const solution = await provideMathematicalReasoning(
  "Solve 2xÂ² + 5x - 3 = 0 and explain each step",
  "high" // education level
);
```

### Conversational Methods (using deepseek-chat)

#### 3. Conversational Learning
```typescript
const response = await engageInConversationalLearning(
  "photosynthesis",
  "I find biology confusing",
  "intermediate"
);
```

#### 4. Creative Content Generation
```typescript
const content = await generateCreativeContent(
  "social media post",
  "renewable energy",
  "teenagers"
);
```

## Usage Examples

### In Components
```typescript
import { useAI } from '@/hooks/useAI';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { 
    solveComplexProblem,
    provideMathematicalReasoning,
    engageInConversationalLearning,
    generateCreativeContent 
  } = useAI();

  // Use the methods as needed
};
```

### In Services
```typescript
import { aiService } from '@/services/aiService';

// The service automatically selects the right model
const result = await aiService.provideHomeworkHelp(question, subject);
// Uses deepseek-reasoner for analytical academic help

const tutorResponse = await aiService.provideAITutorResponse(...);
// Uses deepseek-chat for conversational tutoring
```

## Model Performance Characteristics
