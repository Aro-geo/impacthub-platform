# Lesson Completion and Unlocking Fix

## Issue Fixed
- When a lesson is marked as completed, the UI now properly shows it as completed
- Completing any lesson now correctly unlocks all other lessons
- The UI is updated immediately without requiring a refresh

## Code Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Lesson Unlocking Logic
Modified `LessonsSection.tsx` to ensure lessons are properly unlocked:
```tsx
// Determine if lesson is locked - unlock all lessons if any lesson has been completed
let isLocked = false;
if (index > 0) {
  // Check if ANY lesson has been completed
  const hasAnyCompletedLesson = Array.from(progressMap.values()).some(
    p => p.status === 'completed'
  );
  // Lock only if no lessons have been completed yet
  isLocked = !hasAnyCompletedLesson;
}
```

### 2. Added Event-Based UI Refresh
- Added event listener in `LessonsSection.tsx` to listen for lesson completion events
- Modified `LessonViewer.tsx` to dispatch custom events when a lesson is completed
- This ensures the UI refreshes immediately without requiring a page reload

### 3. Added Debug Utility
Created `lessonUnlockDebugger.ts` with:
- `useLessonUnlockStatus` hook to check and monitor unlock status
- `logLessonUnlockStatus` function to debug lesson unlock issues

## Testing
To verify this fix is working:
1. Open the lessons page
2. Complete any lesson by clicking "Mark Complete"
3. You should see:
   - The completed lesson shows a green "Completed" badge
   - All other lessons are now unlocked
   - No page refresh is required for this to happen

## How It Works
The unlock logic uses a simple rule: if any lesson has been completed, all lessons are unlocked. The first lesson is always unlocked.

When a lesson is completed:
1. The completion status is saved to the database
2. A custom event is dispatched
3. The lessons list component listens for this event and refreshes
4. The refreshed list shows the completed status and unlocks all lessons

If you encounter any issues with lesson unlocking, you can use the debug utility:
```typescript
import { logLessonUnlockStatus } from '@/utils/lessonUnlockDebugger';

// Later in your code
await logLessonUnlockStatus(user.id);
```
