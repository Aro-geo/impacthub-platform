# Lesson Progress RLS Fix - Resolution Summary

## Issues Fixed âœ…

1. **Subject/Lesson Display**: Fixed by removing duplicate foreign key constraint
   - Solution: Kept named constraint `fk_subject` and removed auto-generated constraint
   - Migration file: `20250822000004_fix_duplicate_fk.sql`

2. **Lesson Progress Tracking**: Fixed by improving RLS policies
   - Solution: Created comprehensive RLS policies with proper permissions
   - Migration file: `20250822000006_fix_lesson_progress_rls_enhanced.sql`

## Technical Details

### 1. RLS Policies Implemented

The following RLS policies were successfully added to the `lesson_progress` table:

| Policy Name | Operation | Condition | Purpose |
|-------------|-----------|-----------|---------|
| "Anyone can select lesson_progress" | SELECT | true | Allows all users to view progress data |
| "Auth users can insert their own lesson_progress" | INSERT | auth.uid() = user_id | Restricts inserts to own records |
| "Auth users can update their own lesson_progress" | UPDATE | auth.uid() = user_id | Restricts updates to own records |
| "Auth users can delete their own lesson_progress" | DELETE | auth.uid() = user_id | Restricts deletions to own records |

### 2. Permissions Granted

- The `authenticated` role now has SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE permissions on the table
- The `anon` role has SELECT permission for public access to progress data

### 3. Sequence Permissions

- Added USAGE and SELECT permissions on sequence if using serial IDs

## Troubleshooting Guide

If you encounter any more RLS-related issues:

1. **Verify Authentication Status**:
   - Use the `checkAuthStatus()` function from `databaseRlsDebugger.ts`
   - Check if auth tokens are correctly passed in requests

2. **Check RLS Policies**:
   - Use the `check_rls_policies('lesson_progress')` database function
   - Verify that policies are properly applied

3. **Review Network Requests**:
   - 403 errors indicate permission issues, not missing data
   - Check the exact API endpoint and request payload in browser devtools

4. **Log RLS Errors**:
   - Use the `logRlsError()` function to record detailed diagnostics
   - Helps track down specific permission issues

## Next Steps

1. Test the application thoroughly to ensure all progress tracking works
2. Monitor for any remaining 403 errors in the console
3. Consider adding similar RLS policies to other tables if needed
